Rules of UNO (Simplified Version – Modified for the Hackathon)
Color-changing cards have been customized for the hackathon; standard 'Wild' cards have been replaced or modified.

There are 108 cards in total:
- 76 number cards (0–9)
- 24 action cards (Skip, Reverse, +2)
- 8 Wild cards (Find Color, +4)

Number Cards:
	Each color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) has one "0" card and two of each number from 1–9.
	Number cards can only be placed on another card of the same color or number.

Skip Cards:
	Each color has two Skip cards.
	Skip cards can only be placed on another Skip card or any card of the same color.
	Skip cards cause the next player in rotation to forfeit their turn.

Reverse Cards:
	Each color has two Reverse cards.
	Reverse cards can only be placed on another Reverse card or any card of the same color.
	Reverse cards reverse the direction of play.
	After reversing, the player who played the Reverse card immediately plays again.

+2 Cards:
	Each color has two +2 cards.
	+2 cards can only be placed on another +2 card or any card of the same color.
	+2 cards cause the next player in rotation to pick up 2 cards and forfeit their turn.
	+2 cards can be stacked on top of other +2 cards, increasing the number of cards to be picked up.
	+2 cards can be placed on top of +4 cards if they match the color selected by the +4 card (see "+4 Cards").

Find Color (Wild Card):
	There are four Find Color cards in the deck.
	Find Color cards can be placed on any card.
	They randomly choose one of the four colors to become the new color in play.
	The next player must draw cards one at a time until they draw a card that matches the randomly selected color. All drawn cards are added to their hand.
	The next player in rotation forfeits their turn.
	The active color is changed to the randomly selected color.

+4 Cards (Wild Card):
	There are four +4 cards in the deck.
	+4 cards can be placed on any card.
	They cause the next player in rotation to pick up 4 cards and forfeit their turn.
	+4 cards can be stacked on top of other +4 cards, increasing the number of cards to be picked up.
	+4 cards may not be played on top of +2 cards.
	+4 cards cause the active color to change to a random color.
