# **Vossie Coding Club Hackathon**

Welcome to the Hackathon! Below are the official rules and event structure. Please read them carefully to ensure a fair and competitive environment for all participants.
## Event Overview
-	Duration: Approximately 5 hours
-	Kickoff: The event will begin with an opening session to review the rules and introduce the challenge topic.
-	Objective: Teams will build upon a provided project skeleton to complete a specific programming task. Final submissions will be evaluated against each other to determine the winning team.
Note: The topic and technical requirements will only be revealed at the start of the event. This is to ensure a level playing field for all participants and prevent pre-event preparation.

## Team Structure
-	Minimum Team Size: 2 participants
-	Maximum Team Size: 4 participants
-	Registration fee: R40 per team member
-	Teams must be formed and registered prior to the start of the event.
## Project Setup
-	All teams will receive a common starter codebase in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, and C#).
-	Teams may select any of the supported languages, but must build on the provided skeleton without rewriting core infrastructure.
-	Customization and logic implementation must follow the format defined in the starter materials.
 
## Access & Resource Rules
To promote fairness while enabling efficient onboarding:
### Allowed:
-	Internet access (including AI models, forums, and search engines) is permitted only during the first 45 minutes of programming time.
-	Physical resources (books, printed notes, etc.) are permitted throughout the event, but must be brought at the start--no new physical materials may be introduced during the event.
### Prohibited After 45 Minutes:
-	Accessing any online resources, including:
-	-AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
-	Web searches, documentation sites, and forums
-	-Use of locally hosted or offline AI/LLM tools (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio)
-	-Installing or importing external libraries not explicitly included in the starter code
Violations of these rules may result in disqualification.

## Submission & Evaluation
-	Each team must submit their completed solution before the final deadline announced during the event.
-	Solutions will be evaluated against a consistent set of tests or challenges to determine performance and compliance.
-	The top-performing submission will determine the winning team. Additional awards may be granted at the organizers' discretion.
 

## Conduct & Fair Play
-	All work must be completed during the event. Pre-written code, prior projects, or third-party templates are not allowed.
-	Teams must work independently--collaboration across teams is prohibited.
-	All participants are expected to uphold the spirit of the competition: respectful, honest, and team-focused behavior is required at all times.
## What to Bring
-	A laptop with your preferred development environment installed
-	Any physical reference materials you wish to use
-	Chargers, adapters, and anything else you may need for a productive session
## Final Thoughts
We're excited to see your creativity and problem-solving skills in action. The challenge will be
revealed at the start--come ready to think, build, and compete!
Good luck to all teams!



## Rules of UNO (Simplified Version – Modified for the Hackathon)
Color-changing cards have been customized for the hackathon; standard 'Wild' cards have been replaced or modified.

### There are 108 cards in total:
- 76 number cards (0–9)
- 24 action cards (Skip, Reverse, +2)
- 8 Wild cards (Find Color, +4)

### Number Cards:
	Each color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) has one "0" card and two of each number from 1–9.
	Number cards can only be placed on another card of the same color or number.

### Skip Cards:
	Each color has two Skip cards.
	Skip cards can only be placed on another Skip card or any card of the same color.
	Skip cards cause the next player in rotation to forfeit their turn.

### Reverse Cards:
	Each color has two Reverse cards.
	Reverse cards can only be placed on another Reverse card or any card of the same color.
	Reverse cards reverse the direction of play.
	After reversing, the player who played the Reverse card immediately plays again.

### +2 Cards:
	Each color has two +2 cards.
	+2 cards can only be placed on another +2 card or any card of the same color.
	+2 cards cause the next player in rotation to pick up 2 cards and forfeit their turn.
	+2 cards can be stacked on top of other +2 cards, increasing the number of cards to be picked up.
	+2 cards can be placed on top of +4 cards if they match the color selected by the +4 card (see "+4 Cards").

### Find Color (Wild Card):
	There are four Find Color cards in the deck.
	Find Color cards can be placed on any card.
	They randomly choose one of the four colors to become the new color in play.
	The next player must draw cards one at a time until they draw a card that matches the randomly selected color. All drawn cards are added to their hand.
	The next player in rotation forfeits their turn.
	The active color is changed to the randomly selected color.

### +4 Cards (Wild Card):
	There are four +4 cards in the deck.
	+4 cards can be placed on any card.
	They cause the next player in rotation to pick up 4 cards and forfeit their turn.
	+4 cards can be stacked on top of other +4 cards, increasing the number of cards to be picked up.
	+4 cards may not be played on top of +2 cards.
	+4 cards cause the active color to change to a random color.

### Card Summary:
| Type         | Total Cards |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Number cards | 76          |
| Action cards | 24          |
| Wild cards   | 8           |
| Total        | 108         |

### Setup:
- Each player receives seven random cards.
- Remaining cards are placed face-down on the table.
- The top card is flipped to start the discard pile.

### Gameplay:
- Players take turns matching a card from their hand to the top card of the discard pile.
- If a player has no playable card, they must draw one card from the draw pile.
- If the drawn card is playable, it must be played.

### Winning:
- The first player with no cards left wins.
- Wild cards may be played at any time (within their rules) to alter the game.
